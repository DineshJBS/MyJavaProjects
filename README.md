This is a Java-based bus reservation . It's text-based running in an IDE console environment. 
I have created this project to understand more about how Java works as well as to study and practise the concepts of OOPS. 
I have used concepts like ArrayList, Function variables, input and output, conditionals, and loops  in detail, as well as the concept of the OOPs..
Tech stack used : Core Java, Collections.
In the first version I used collections - ArrayList to store data, in updated version I have used Database - MySQL and JDBC for data management.
